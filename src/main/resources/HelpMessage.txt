The purpose of this program is to make "picture cards," 
images of identical size laid out on a page with black 
lines between them for ease of uniform cutting and 
(if desired) lamination. Cards will be laid out
left-to-right, top-to-bottom. The contents of a card
can either be text (the color of which you select) or
an image file (jpg, png, gif, etc.). For making a text
card, simply click on the "Text Mode" button for the
image in question, input your text, and choose a color.
For making an image card, make sure that the image is in
file mode (this is the default) and either drag and drop 
an image file from your desktop or file explorer into the 
"File" box, or press the "Select a File" button. You can 
freely set the quantity for each card, and once all of 
the requested cards are on the page, they will repeat 
until the horizontal and vertical boxes are all filled up.
If you want all of the cards to have the same quantity, 
feel free to make use of the handy "Set Quantities To..."
button.

The order of images can be rearranged with the arrows, in a way
that should hopefully be self-evident.
